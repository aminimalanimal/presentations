## Overview

This slideshow is created with [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

fwiw, I couldn't actually **build** Remark with their instructions, and had to resort to ripping already-built files out of other examples. Pretty simple stuff to get it set up, thoughâ€”reference the js, reference the css, and host the html.

## How to Run/View the Project

- Navigate to Accessibility UX base directory (the directory with index.html in it)
- In Terminal, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

## How to Edit

- Open `accessibility_ux.md`
- Edit as Markdown
