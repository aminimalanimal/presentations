## how to use a screen reader

## your users

- the blind
- the not-blind
- the partially blind
- the color blind
- the physically impaired
- keyboard users
- your grandparents
- people will no patience
- and me

## a one to one experience

- everything that you see, you must be able to touch, hover over, click on, etc. It's got to work for all devices
	- people on touch screens
	- people on desktop computers
	- people 
- nothing can be hidden. There is no spirit realm.
- generally, alternative text: don't do it. Let all users see what's necessary.

## a linear experience

- element order, ideally, is arranged left-to-right top-to-bottom (assuming it's an English page).

## responsive difficulties

- thou shalt not switch input types

## pushing the limits within the limits





## misc - for design

- focus states focus states focus states
	- embrace these. make them cool!
- color contrast
	- there be standards for compliance
	- your icons don't matterâ€”actually, all that matters is text on a background
		- so this (pic of text on a crazy background) is bad



## A look at particular components

### Dropdown Menus

### Forms

- where to place important information
- the expectation of being able to tab through an entire form
- creating related content
	- fieldsets and how they sound

#### Input types

##### Naming Conventions
##### Error Messaging
##### Tooltips

- multiple constraints:
	- we can either treat these as modals
	- or have them read immediately

### Modals

### Expandable Content



### Replaceable content

#### Don't redirect focus
